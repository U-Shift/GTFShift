Description: GTFShift emerged from the necessity to perform systematic analysis for academic research
  over General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) files that were not supported by any R library. It compiles 
  the methods developed for this purpose, aiming to contribute to an open source culture.
  Its functionality is built mostly on [tidytransit](https://r-transit.github.io/tidytransit/) package.
