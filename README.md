GTFShift emerged from the necessity to perform systematic analysis for academic research
over General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) files that were not supported by any R library. 

It compiles the methods developed for this purpose, aiming to contribute to an open source culture.

## Installation

You can install the development version of GTFShift from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("U-Shift/GTFShift")
```
