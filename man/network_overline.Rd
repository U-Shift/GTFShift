\title{Aggregate lines based on overlap with simplified network}
\usage{
network_overline(
  network,
  df,
  attr,
  network_segment_length = 100,
  fun = dplyr::sum
)
}
\arguments{
\item{network}{sf. A spatial object representing the simplified network.}

\item{df}{sf. A spatial object representing the lines to aggregate.}

\item{attr}{String. The attribute to aggregate the lines by.}

\item{network_segment_length}{Integer. (Default 100) If not NA, network is split in segments of defined meters.}

\item{fun.}{Method. (Default sim) Function to summarise the attributes by.}
}
\value{
A spatial object of the network provided, extended with the aggregated values. A `segment` column will be also added to the network, as a unique identifier used for the aggregation process.
}
\description{
Aggregate lines based on overlap with simplified network
}
\details{
This method allows for the lines aggregation. Given a simplified network, it identifies (using `stplanr::rnet_join()`)
the segments corresponding to each line and uses them to aggregate the attribute defined in the parameters.
