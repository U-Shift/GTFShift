\description{
Download GTFS file fixing any irregularities.
}
\details{
In addition to downloading the GTFS feed zip file, this method validates its integrity and applies the proper corrections if it does not comply with the following validations:
- `stop_times.txt` with empty `arrival_time` or `departure_time`, filtering rows that do not comply;
- Feeds with missing `shapes.txt` file, generating it with `GTFShift::create_shapes`.
