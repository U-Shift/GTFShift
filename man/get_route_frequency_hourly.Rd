\title{Get aggregated frequency per hour for each bus route}
\usage{
get_route_frequency_hourly(gtfs, date = NULL, overline = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{gtfs}{tidygtfs. GTFS feed.}

\item{date}{Date. Reference date to consider when analysing the GTFS file. Defaults to next business Wednesday in Portugal.}

\item{overline}{Boolean. Defaults to FALSE. If TRUE, routes are aggregated using stplanr::overline2, overlapping lines and converting them into a single route network.}
}
\value{
An `sf` `data.frame` object with the following columns (the first three are only present if `overline=FALSE`):
\itemize{
 \item `route_id`, the `route_id` attribute from `routes.txt` file.
 \item `route_short_name`, the `route_short_name` attribute from `routes.txt` file.
 \item `direction_id`, the `direction_id` attribute from `trips.txt` file.
 \item `arrival_hour`, the hour for which the frequency applies (24 hour format).
 \item `frequency`, the number of services for the route that depart from the first stop for the corresponding 60 minutes period.
 \item `geometry`, the route shape.
}
}
\description{
For each route, returns the number of departures aggregated per hour.
}
\details{
This method analyses the GTFS feed for a representative day, generating for each route the number of services aggregated per hour.
For a detailed example, see the \code{vignette("analyse")}.
