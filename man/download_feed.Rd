\description{
Read GTFS feed, fixing integrity errors
}
\details{
In addition to loading the GTFS feed, this method validates its integrity and applies the proper corrections if it does not comply with the following validations:
\itemize{
 \item `stop_times.txt` with empty `arrival_time` or `departure_time`, filtering rows that do not comply.
 \item Feeds with missing `shapes.txt` file, generating it using `GTFSwizard::get_shapes()`.
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
gtfs <- GTFShift::download_feed("https://operator.com/gtfs.zip")
}
