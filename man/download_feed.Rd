\details{
In addition to downloading the GTFS feed zip file, this method validates its integrity and applies the proper corrections if it does not comply with the following validations:
\itemize{
 \item `stop_times.txt` with empty `arrival_time` or `departure_time`, filtering rows that do not comply;
 \item Feeds with missing `shapes.txt` file, generating it with `GTFShift::create_shapes`.
}
}

\dontrun{
download("https://operator.com/gtfs.zip", "operator_gtfs.zip")
